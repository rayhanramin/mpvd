16,CWE CATEGORY: Configuration,Weaknesses in this category are typically introduced during the configuration of the software.
17,CWE CATEGORY: DEPRECATED: Code,"This entry has been deprecated. It was originally used for organizing the Development View (CWE-699) and some other views, but it introduced unnecessary complexity and depth to the resulting tree."
20,CWE-20: Improper Input Validation,"The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly."
22,CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal'),"The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory."
74,CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection'),"The software constructs all or part of a command, data structure, or record using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify how it is parsed or interpreted when it is sent to a downstream component."
79,CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'),The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.
91,CWE-91: XML Injection (aka Blind XPath Injection),"The software does not properly neutralize special elements that are used in XML, allowing attackers to modify the syntax, content, or commands of the XML before it is processed by an end system."
94,CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection'),"The software constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment."
119,CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer,"The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer."
125,CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read,"The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer."
129,CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index,"The product uses untrusted input when calculating or using an array index, but the product does not validate or incorrectly validates the index to ensure the index references a valid position within the array."
189,CWE CATEGORY: Numeric Errors,Weaknesses in this category are related to improper calculation or conversion of numbers.
190,CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound,"The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control."
199,CWE CATEGORY: Information Management Errors,Weaknesses in this category are related to improper handling of sensitive information.
200,CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.
254,CWE CATEGORY: 7PK - Security Features,"Software security is not security software. Here we're concerned with topics like authentication, access control, confidentiality, cryptography, and privilege management."
255,CWE CATEGORY: Credentials Management Errors,Weaknesses in this category are related to the management of credentials.
264,"CWE CATEGORY: Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls","Weaknesses in this category are related to the management of permissions, privileges, and other security features that are used to perform access control."
269,CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management,"The software does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor."
275,CWE CATEGORY: Permission Issues,Weaknesses in this category are related to improper assignment or handling of permissions.
284,CWE-284: Improper Access Control,The software does not restrict or incorrectly restricts access to a resource from an unauthorized actor.
287,CWE-287: Improper Authentication,"When an actor claims to have a given identity, the software does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct."
310,CWE CATEGORY: Cryptographic Issues,"Weaknesses in this category are related to the design and implementation of data confidentiality and integrity. Frequently these deal with the use of encoding techniques, encryption libraries, and hashing algorithms. The weaknesses in this category could lead to a degradation of the quality data if they are not addressed."
311,CWE-311: Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data,The software does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission.
326,CWE-326: Inadequate Encryption Strength,"The software stores or transmits sensitive data using an encryption scheme that is theoretically sound, but is not strong enough for the level of protection required."
346,CWE-346: Origin Validation Error,The software does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.
347,CWE-347: Improper Verification of Cryptographic Signature,"The software does not verify, or incorrectly verifies, the cryptographic signature for data."
352,CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF),"The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request."
362,CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'),"The program contains a code sequence that can run concurrently with other code, and the code sequence requires temporary, exclusive access to a shared resource, but a timing window exists in which the shared resource can be modified by another code sequence that is operating concurrently."
388,CWE CATEGORY: 7PK - Errors,"This category represents one of the phyla in the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms vulnerability classification. It includes weaknesses that occur when an application does not properly handle errors that occur during processing. According to the authors of the Seven Pernicious Kingdoms, ""Errors and error handling represent a class of API. Errors related to error handling are so common that they deserve a special kingdom of their own. As with 'API Abuse,' there are two ways to introduce an error-related security vulnerability: the most common one is handling errors poorly (or not at all). The second is producing errors that either give out too much information (to possible attackers) or are difficult to handle."""
399,CWE CATEGORY: Resource Management Errors,Weaknesses in this category are related to improper management of system resources.
416,CWE-416: Use After Free,"Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code."
426,CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path,The application searches for critical resources using an externally-supplied search path that can point to resources that are not under the application's direct control.
476,CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference,"A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit."
522,CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials,"The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval."
682,CWE-682: Incorrect Calculation,The software performs a calculation that generates incorrect or unintended results that are later used in security-critical decisions or resource management.
704,CWE-704: Incorrect Type Conversion or Cast,"The software does not correctly convert an object, resource, or structure from one type to a different type."
732,CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource,The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.
787,CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write,"The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer."
824,CWE-824: Access of Uninitialized Pointer,The program accesses or uses a pointer that has not been initialized.
829,CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere,"The software imports, requires, or includes executable functionality (such as a library) from a source that is outside of the intended control sphere."
1187,CWE-1187: DEPRECATED: Use of Uninitialized Resource,This entry has been deprecated because it was a duplicate of CWE-908. All content has been transferred to CWE-908.
